    <p>
        URI that will be linked with every Commit added to a Rally Work Item's Changeset.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have a web-accessible repository browser and wish to deeply link into that system with
        commits linked in Rally Changesets, use the <kbd>${revision}</kbd> and <kbd>${repiository}</kbd> variables to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if you want a commit with hash <i>12ab34cd56ef</i> to be accessible at
        <i>http://github.com/your-name/your-project/commits/12ab34cd56ef</i> then you would set this property as:
        <kbd>http://github.com/your-name/your-project/commits/${revision}</kbd>
    </p>
    <p>
        Or if you defined your rallyScmName to be <i>your-name/your-project</i>, then
        <i>http://github.com/your-name/your-project/commits/12ab34cd56ef</i> then you would set this property as:
        <kbd>http://github.com/${repository}/commits/${revision}</kbd>
    </p>

</div>
